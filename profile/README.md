# Ruby Memoist

Matthew Rudy created memoist and memoist2.  He passed away in 2019, and left us with beautiful code, having memoized a part of himself.

- [memoist](https://github.com/memoist/memoist) ([original](https://github.com/matthewrudy/memoist))
- [memoist2](https://github.com/memoist/memoist2) ([original](https://github.com/matthewrudy/memoist2))

I am not sure if we will get the gem push rights, or if the original repos will come back to life via current owners, or if we will need to change the name of the gem.

You may donate to [No Stomach For Cancer](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/inmemoryofmatthewjacobs) in his memory.
